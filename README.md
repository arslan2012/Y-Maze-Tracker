# Y Maze Tracker

tracks mouse inside a Y maze


## Usage

- select the desired tracking method
- File -> Open open the video file
- click the three vertex of the maze, press enter to preview the result, press enter again to confirm
- box select the mouse, remember to leave some space in the box, and press enter to confirm
- let it run, and check it's status, if tracking failed, try again with different tracker or different bounding box

## Problem

All of the tracker uses default settings, cuz I'm too lazy to implement the ui to change them.
